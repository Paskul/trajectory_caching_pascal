# Trajectory caching workflow -- Pascal

### Launching

### Notes
Caching is currently configured for the ur5e arm (and joints) at the `test` position found in the `harvest` repo. As of writing, this correlates to joint states (and is hardcoded as):
| Joint  | Position |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `shoulder_pan_joint`  | `1.54` |
| `shoulder_lift_joint`  | `-1.62`  |
| `elbow_joint`  | `1.40` |
| `wrist_1_joint`  | `-1.20` |
| `wrist_2_joint`  | `-1.60` |
| `wrist_3_joint`  | `-0.11` |
